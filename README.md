# React Debugging Challenge

**Time Limit: 15 minutes**

## Instructions
This React app is supposed to be a simple Task Manager, but it has several bugs! The app renders, but many features are broken.

## Expected Functionality
1. Users should be able to add new tasks using the input field and "Add Task" button
2. Each task should display with a checkbox to mark it as complete
3. Completed tasks should have a strikethrough style
4. Users should be able to delete tasks using the "Delete" button
5. The task counter should show the correct number of incomplete tasks
6. The "Clear Completed" button should remove all completed tasks

## Your Task
Find and fix ALL the bugs in the application. There are bugs in:
- HTML/JSX structure
- CSS styling
- JavaScript/React logic

## Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Good luck!
